imv - Image viewer for X11 and Wayland

Description
-----------

imv is an image viewer for X11 and Wayland, aimed at users of tiling window
managers. It supports a wide variety of image file formats, including animated
gif files. imv will automatically reload the current image, if it is changed on
disk.

Synopsis
--------
'imv' [options] [paths...]

Options
-------

	Start with the given path, or index selected.

*-r*::
	Load directories recursively.

*-s* <none|shrink|full>::
	Set scaling mode to use. 'none' will show each image at its actual size.
	'shrink' will scale down the image to fit inside the window. 'full' will
	both scale up and scale down the image to fit perfectly inside the window.

Configuration
-------------

The path to a config file can be given via the *$imv_config* environment
variable. If not found, imv will search for it in the following locations:

- $HOME/.imv_config
- $HOME/.imv/config
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/imv/config (recommended)
- /usr/local/etc/imv_config
- /etc/imv_config

A default config file is shipped with imv into /etc/imv_config

For documentation on the config file format, see **imv**(5).
